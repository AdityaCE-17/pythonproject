# pythonproject
Using python and pygame modules to develop games for simulation lab project.

ABOUT:
This project started out as a submission for Process Simulation Lab in the sixth semester of B.Chem.Engg.
This project entails development of games for better understanding of python codes and their applications.

GAME 1 : Hangman
A twist on the Classic Hangman....I have designed a "Movies Hangman".
Guess the movie in 6 guesses (usual hangman rules apply).
Right now the library of movies is limited to few titles.


GAME 2 : Dementor Defense
A magical twist on the age old game of Spaceship.....incorporating elements of Potterverse.
I could not find better art for the player's character....thus using a waterwizard (Google images).
Dementor art is block like and not freeform.
Defend against the waves of Dementors with "Expecto patronum" bolts before they breach the "Patronus" Shield.

Final Notes:
Existing games may be augmented with full feldged animations and sounds.
I would like to work and collaborate on developing other games based on popular themes such as 
* Game of Thrones
* Lord of The Rings
* One Punch Man
* Dragonball Z
